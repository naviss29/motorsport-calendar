"""Abstract base for ACO-organised endurance series scraped via schema.org JSON-LD.

WEC, ELMS and Michelin Le Mans Cup are all organised by the Automobile Club
de l'Ouest and run on the same web platform/CMS — confirmed empirically
(Sprint 35) by comparing raw HTML across the three sites, not assumed:
every race detail page (``/en/race/{slug}``) embeds a single
``<script type="application/ld+json">`` block describing a schema.org
``SportsEvent`` with a ``subEvent`` array, one entry per session, each with
an exact ISO 8601 timestamp (including UTC offset). The season list page
(``/en/season/{year}``) has no such structured data — it is scraped only
for the list of race slugs to visit.

This base class implements that two-step pipeline (season page -> race
slugs -> per-race JSON-LD) once; subclasses declare only series-specific
configuration (base URL, session-label -> SessionType mapping, circuit
timezones, event name prefix).

Two data-shape quirks handled generically here, not per-series:
  - Some rounds run *class-specific* qualifying as several back-to-back
    slots (e.g. "Qualifying session LMP2", "Qualifying session LMGT3" a few
    minutes apart) — these would all map to ``SessionType.QUALIFYING`` and
    collide on ICS UID (``{event_uid}-{session.type}``, see
    ``exporters/ics.py``). Rather than the F1 Academy-style workaround of
    relabelling extra sessions to an unrelated SessionType (see ADR-016),
    same-type sessions within one event are merged into a single Session
    spanning from the first slot's start to the last slot's end — an
    honest simplification (a calendar entry "Qualifying, 15:05-16:45" is
    more useful than four near-duplicate 25-minute entries), and it keeps
    UID uniqueness for free instead of via a relabelling trick.
  - Pre-season test days ("Official Tests - X", "Collective Tests - X")
    are excluded from the season's race list — they are not championship
    rounds, and (per Sprint 35 investigation) their session structure
    doesn't fit the FP/Qualifying/Race shape at all ("Morning Session" /
    "Afternoon Session" repeated across multiple days, which would also
    collide on SessionType). Every other provider in this project already
    only covers championship rounds, not private testing.

#     SessionType already in the domain model) covers "Hyperpole"/
#     "Hyperpole 1"/"Hyperpole 2" via startswith, same as every other rule.
#   - "Warm-up" (Le Mans race-morning session) maps to TEST — the closest
#     existing SessionType, since the domain model has no dedicated
#     warm-up type; kept distinct from "Free Practice 4" so the two (which
