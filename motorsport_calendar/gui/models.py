    not necessarily implemented: the Préférences page renders them as
    inert "coming soon" rows (see ``views/preferences.py::_PREF_ROWS``),
    but a typed model already exists so a future sprint that makes one of
    them real only has to wire persistence, not invent the shape.

                     in ``main_view.py``), never read from here yet.

                     ``Strings.from_dict`` already anticipates this, see
                     its own docstring; not wired to this field yet.
