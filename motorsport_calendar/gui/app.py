Usage:
    motocal-gui

Assets (Sprint 49 — Brand Set v1.0, see gui/assets/logo/README.md): served
from ``gui/assets/`` — icon.png/icon_windows.ico (window/taskbar icon,
``page.window.icon`` set in ``main_view.py``), favicon-16/32.png, and
``logo/`` (mc-icon.svg/logo-horizontal.svg/logo-vertical.svg, not yet
consumed by any view — see that README for the anticipated call sites,
unchanged this sprint: no Design System evolution).
