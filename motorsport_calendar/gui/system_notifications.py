"""System notifications — the one OS-dependent layer for real notification
delivery (Sprint 56).

``gui/notification_service.py`` (Sprint 46) already computes *what*/*when*
to notify — a platform-agnostic ``Notification`` — and stays that way: it
must never import this module, never know "Windows"/"Linux"/"macOS". This
module is the only place in the whole app allowed to know that a platform
exists at all, and it decides exactly one thing: *how* (or whether) a
computed ``Notification`` becomes a real, visible OS notification.

Verified fact, not a hypothesis (checked against the installed
``flet==0.85.3`` package before writing a line of this module): Flet ships
no system/OS notification service on any platform. Its full service-control
roster (``flet.controls.services.*``) is accelerometer, barometer, battery,
browser_context_menu, clipboard, connectivity, file_picker, gyroscope,
haptic_feedback, magnetometer, screen_brightness, semantics_service,
shake_detector, shared_preferences, share, storage_paths, url_launcher,
user_accelerometer, wakelock — 20 services, none of them "notification" or
"toast" or "tray". ``ft.Window`` has no tray-icon/balloon-notification API
either (its full method surface is ``wait_until_ready_to_show``/
``destroy``/``center``/``close``/``to_front``/``start_dragging``/
``start_resizing`` — nothing notification-shaped). Flet's own Dart-side
changelog (``CHANGELOG.md`` bundled with the pub.dev package) mentions
"notifications" exactly once, for **scroll** notifications (an unrelated
UI concept) — never once for OS/system notifications, in any release up
to 0.85.3.

Per the sprint brief's explicit instruction — "ne jamais réécrire un
système de notifications si Flet en fournit déjà un" (moot: it doesn't)
and "si aucune solution native propre n'existe : ne pas bricoler, créer
uniquement une abstraction prête à recevoir une future implémentation" —
this module does not bundle a third-party notification library (``plyer``,
``winotify``, ``notify-py``, D-Bus/``notify2``, ...) to paper over that
gap. Adding one is a real, deliberate decision (new dependency, new
per-platform packaging/permission concerns — see ``docs/PACKAGING.md``)
that belongs to whichever future sprint actually wires in real dispatch,
not to this one. What exists today is the seam: ``SystemNotifier`` (the
interface a future implementation fills in), ``NullSystemNotifier`` (the
only implementation shipped this sprint — always unavailable, by
construction, never a workaround), and ``notify_all`` (the one entry
point ``main_view.py`` calls — it never touches ``SystemNotifier`` itself).
