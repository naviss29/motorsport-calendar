"""Event metadata normalization — Sprint 32.

Turns a raw domain ``Event`` into display-ready metadata for a
ChampionshipCard: which Grand Prix name to show, which circuit line (if
any), which country line (if any). This is the "dedicated logic" the
component itself must never contain — ``championship_card.py`` only
renders whatever it is given; every decision about *what* to show or hide
happens here.

Root cause investigation (why F1 looks better than F2/F3/F1 Academy)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Confirmed by inspecting real provider output for the same weekend:

    formula1 | event.name='Belgian Grand Prix' | circuit.name='Spa-Francorchamps'
             | circuit.city='Spa-Francorchamps' | circuit.country='Belgium'
    formula2 | event.name='Belgian'             | circuit.name='Belgian'
             | circuit.city='Spa-Francorchamps' | circuit.country='Unknown'
    formula3 | event.name='Australian'          | circuit.name='Australian'
             | circuit.city='Melbourne'         | circuit.country='Australia'

Two independent causes, not one:

1. **A genuine, external API/dataset difference** (not a bug we can fix
   without touching providers). F1 (Jolpica/Ergast) returns a rich,
   dedicated field per race: a full ``raceName`` ("Belgian Grand Prix"), a
   real ``circuitName`` ("Spa-Francorchamps"), and a real country. F2/F3/F1
   Academy all come from the ``sportstimes/f1`` open dataset
   (f1calendar.com), which is far more minimal: each entry only has a short
   round descriptor (``name``: "Belgian", "Australian" — no "Grand Prix"
   suffix, no separate circuit-name field at all) and a ``location`` field
   that is closer to a venue/circuit name than an actual city (mapped to
   ``Circuit.city``). There is nothing richer to parse out of that dataset.

2. **A parsing/mapping choice in our own code**, in
   ``providers/support_series/f1calendar_base.py::_build_circuit`` —
   ``Circuit.name`` is set to the *same* short round descriptor as
   ``Event.name``, which is why the two end up identical ("Belgian" /
   "Belgian"). The dataset's ``location`` field (mapped to ``Circuit.city``)
   is actually a better circuit-name candidate and is already sitting
   there, just not used for that purpose. This is fixable — in the
   provider, which this sprint does not touch — not a domain-model
   limitation (``Circuit``/``Event`` have plenty of room for the right
   values; the F2/F3/F1 Academy provider code just doesn't have a good
   value to put in ``Circuit.name`` beyond what the dataset gives it).

   A secondary, separate gap: the static ``_CIRCUIT_DATA`` country lookup
   tables for F2/F3/F1 Academy are incomplete (many slugs are simply
   missing), which is why ``Circuit.country`` so often falls back to the
   literal sentinel ``"Unknown"`` for those series but rarely for F1. F3's
   table happens to cover more circuits than F2's, which is why F3 shows a
   real country ("Australia") for some events that F2 shows "Unknown" for
   — coverage varies per support-series module, not by design.

Given the constraint not to touch providers this sprint, this module
compensates entirely in the presentation layer: it never trusts
``Circuit.name`` blindly, falls back to ``Circuit.city`` when it looks like
a duplicate of the event name, and hides a line outright rather than ever
showing "Unknown", an empty line, or two identical lines.
