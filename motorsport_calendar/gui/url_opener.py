"""url_opener — the one "open this URL in the system browser" helper
(Sprint 57 — Préparation Beta, nettoyage).

Before this sprint, the exact same try/``url_launcher.launch_url``/except/
``subprocess.Popen`` Windows fallback existed independently in 2 places
(``views/about.py``'s GitHub link, Sprint 26; ``main_view.py::
_make_release_opener``, Sprint 51/53) and was about to become a 3rd copy
for "Soutenir le projet"'s GitHub Discussions/Issues buttons. Promoted here
once a 3rd real call site made the duplication concrete rather than
theoretical — same "mutualize on the second/third real use" principle
already applied throughout this project (providers, ChampionshipCard,
championship_selector, ``_open_event_details``/``_open_circuit_details``).

No Flet control is built here — this only returns the ``on_click``
callable a caller wires onto whichever button/link it owns.
