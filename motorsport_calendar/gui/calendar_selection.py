"""Mon calendrier — pure logic to summarize the current year/championship selection.

No Flet, no I/O: fetching lives in ``controller.get_calendar_year_events``. This
module only turns already-fetched events into a display-ready summary, so it
is fully unit-testable with plain ``Event``/``Session`` fixtures — no HTTP
mocking needed. Mirrors ``upcoming_weekend.py``/``dashboard.py``'s own
separation of "fetch" (controller) vs "compute" (this module).

Sprint 40: "Mon calendrier" becomes a browsable calendar, not just a
generation wizard — this summary (event/session counts, period covered) is
what turns "filter by year" + "filter by championship" into live,
explorable feedback, shown before the user ever reaches "Créer mon
calendrier". Every registered championship's events for the browsed year
are fetched once (``controller.get_calendar_year_events``); toggling a
championship checkbox is then a purely local computation over
already-fetched data — no network call per toggle.
