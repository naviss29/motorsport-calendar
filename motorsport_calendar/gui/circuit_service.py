"""CircuitService — a queryable circuit database built from events already
loaded in memory (Sprint 47).

Circuits were, until now, plain text on a ChampionshipCard — this module
promotes them to first-class entities: aggregated across every
championship/season already fetched, a circuit becomes something with its
own name, country, list of championships that have raced there, and event
history. No network call here — building the database is purely a local
aggregation over ``year_events``, the exact same dict
``controller.get_calendar_year_events`` already produces and
``search_service.py``/``notification_service.py``/``season_explorer.py``
already consume.

Reuses existing models end-to-end rather than inventing a second
normalization: ``event_display.circuit_display_name``/``normalize_key``/
``resolve_country`` (Sprint 32, ADR-023; promoted to public at Sprint 47)
for a circuit's own name/identity/country, ``display_names.get_display_name``
for championship names — a circuit is never named or grouped differently
here than anywhere else in the app.
