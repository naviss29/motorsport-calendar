"""Tableau de bord — pure logic to aggregate season-wide + weekend stats.

No Flet, no I/O: fetching lives in ``controller.get_dashboard_data`` (which
reuses the exact same fetch pipeline as ``get_upcoming_weekend`` — see
``controller._fetch_weekend_entries``). This module only turns
already-fetched entries into a display-ready result, so it is fully
unit-testable with plain ``Event``/``Session`` fixtures — no HTTP mocking
needed. Mirrors ``upcoming_weekend.py``'s own separation of "fetch"
(controller) vs "compute" (this module).

Sprint 39: the Dashboard becomes the app's home page. It deliberately
reuses ``upcoming_weekend.find_upcoming_weekend`` for the "prochain
week-end" + "championnats présents ce week-end" stats instead of
re-implementing weekend-finding — "Ce week-end" and the Dashboard always
agree on what the next race weekend is, by construction.

Sprint 44: ``build_dashboard_data`` accepts an optional ``favorite_ids``,
forwarded as-is to ``find_upcoming_weekend`` — favorited championships are
shown first in ``DashboardData.weekend.cards``, the exact same "favorites
first" logic "Ce week-end" uses (never a second implementation).

Sprint 53: the Dashboard becomes the app's real home page (not just its
first tab) — ``DashboardData`` grows 5 fields for the "Nouveautés"/"État
de Motorsport Calendar" sections, all passthrough values resolved by
``controller.get_dashboard_data`` (registry/config/FavoritesService/
UpdateService — never a new service, per the sprint brief), except
``functional_providers``, genuinely computed here from *entries* (the one
new field that IS "aggregate stats from already-fetched entries", this
module's actual job).
