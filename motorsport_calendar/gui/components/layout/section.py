"""Section / SectionHeader — grouping and sub-headings within a page body.

``Section`` owns the gap *between* related blocks — no view should
hand-roll an ``ft.Container(height=...)`` spacer between two blocks again;
wrap them in a ``Section`` instead. ``SectionHeader`` is a distinct,
smaller heading used *inside* a Section (e.g. to label one of several
card groups on a future Recherche/Tableau de bord page) — it is not a
substitute for ``PageHeader``, which owns the page's own title.
