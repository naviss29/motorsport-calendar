"""ComingSoonRow — the one "prepared, not yet real" row shape.

Promoted here (Sprint 57) once a 2nd real consumer needed the exact same
shape ``views/preferences.py``'s own ``_pref_row`` already had since
Sprint 52 (icon + label + a muted "Disponible prochainement" chip, in a
bordered card) — "Soutenir le projet"'s PayPal/GitHub Sponsors slots are
prepared exactly the same way: a labeled place-holder, no real link yet.
Same "mutualize on the second real use" principle already applied
throughout this project (providers, ChampionshipCard,
championship_selector, ``url_opener.make_url_opener``).
