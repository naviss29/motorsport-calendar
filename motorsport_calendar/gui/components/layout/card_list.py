"""CardList — the one reusable vertical list of cards.

Uniform vertical spacing for a list of cards — the layout concern only.
A future separator between items is a natural extension point if a list
ever needs one, but nothing builds it today: no current caller needs it,
and an unused option is dead weight, not readiness.

Used today by Ce week-end (one ChampionshipCard per event); tomorrow by
Favoris, Recherche, Tableau de bord, Notifications, Historique — any page
showing a list of cards.
