"""ChampionshipCard — the one reusable race-card layout for the whole app.

Sprint 30: extracted out of ``gui/views/weekend.py`` so no view ever needs
to rebuild this layout again. Today it is used by Ce week-end; the same
card is meant for Favoris, Recherche, Tableau de bord, Calendrier,
Notifications and Historique whenever any of them need to show "a
championship's event" — same header, same session grid, same footer slot.

The component knows only ``ChampionshipCardData`` (this module's own model)
— never an ``Event``/``Session``/``Championship``/``Circuit`` domain object,
never a provider, never why/how the data was fetched. Callers (e.g.
``upcoming_weekend.py`` today; a future ``favorites.py``/``search.py``
controller tomorrow) are responsible for turning their own domain data into
this model. That is what keeps the component reusable: it never needs to
change when a *new* screen wants to show the same kind of card.

Sprint 32: ``circuit_name``/``country`` are optional. Deciding whether a
line is missing/redundant/"Unknown" is business logic (see
``gui/event_display.py``) that must never live here — this module only
renders whichever lines it is handed, skipping any that are ``None``.

Design: built entirely from existing ``theme.py`` primitives (``theme.card``,
``theme.Spacing``/``FontSize``/``Colors``) — no new colors, spacing values,
or tokens introduced.

Sprint 33: the championship name is preceded by its logo, resolved through
``championship_assets.get_championship_asset()`` — the component never
knows a file path or special-cases a championship id. When no logo is
available (unknown id, or a known id whose logo has not been delivered
yet) the title renders exactly as before, with no reserved empty space.
