"""SearchService — instant, offline search across championships, events,
and circuits already loaded in memory (Sprint 45).

No network calls, ever: the caller (``main_view.py``) builds an index once
from data it already fetched for other purposes — the registered
championship ids (``controller.list_championships``) and ``year_events``,
the exact same dict "Mon calendrier"'s season explorer already uses
(Sprint 40/41) — never a fresh provider scan per keystroke. Rebuilding the
index (e.g. when the user changes year on "Mon calendrier") is
main_view.py's job; searching against whatever index currently exists is
this module's only concern, and is O(index size), never O(fetch).

Reuses existing models end-to-end rather than inventing a second
normalization: ``display_names.get_display_name`` for championship names,
``event_display.normalize_event_display`` (Sprint 32, ADR-023) for event/
circuit display names — the exact same rules already used by
``ChampionshipCard``/the season explorer, so a circuit or event never
reads differently in search results than it does everywhere else in the
app. ``event_display.normalize_key`` (promoted here from this module at
Sprint 47 once ``gui/circuit_service.py`` needed the exact same "compact"
identity normalization for circuit deduplication) is the one place that
answers "are these two spellings the same real-world entity" — never
reimplemented a second time.
