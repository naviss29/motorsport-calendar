"""Championship visual identity registry — Sprint 33.

Single entry point mapping a ``championship_id`` to its visual assets —
a logo today, possibly a color or an icon tomorrow. No view or component
is allowed to know a file path, or to special-case a specific
championship (``if championship_id == "formula1"``); they all call
``get_championship_asset()`` and render whatever comes back, including a
fully empty result.

Delivering an official logo later is a pure data change: drop the file at
``gui/assets/championships/<filename>`` (see the README in that folder)
— nothing in this module, in ``championship_card.py``, or in any view
needs to change.

No logo file exists in the repository yet (see
``gui/assets/championships/README.md``) — every championship therefore
resolves to ``logo_src=None`` today. Callers are required to handle
``None`` gracefully (no blank space, no broken-image placeholder); this
is the same contract already used for ``event_display.py``'s optional
metadata lines.
