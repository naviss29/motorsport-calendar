# RELEASE.md — Building and publishing a Motorsport Calendar release

Sprint 58 (Validation Packaging Beta). This document is the step-by-step
release procedure — generate the Linux/Windows builds, assemble them into
a local `Release/` folder, and publish a GitHub Release. For the deep
technical detail behind each build command (what Flet actually produces,
file sizes, dependency verification, known issues), see
`docs/PACKAGING.md` — this document assumes that one and does not repeat
its content.

> **✅ The blocker documented here previously is fixed.** `docs/
> PACKAGING.md` §6 originally found the Linux build crashing on startup
> (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'motorsport_calendar'`) —
> `docs/PACKAGING.md` §7 documents the fix (a build-only
> `motorsport_calendar/gui/pyproject.toml`), verified by an actual
> rebuild and a real launch of the resulting binary (no crash, no
> traceback). The build command below is unchanged by the fix. One
> cosmetic item remains open (embedded build version reads `1.0.0`
> instead of the real `0.2.0` — see `docs/PACKAGING.md` §7's own note);
> it does not affect whether the app runs.

## 1. Release checklist (overview)

1. Decide the version number and update `pyproject.toml` (`version =
   "..."`, this is the single source of truth for the version — the CLI
   (`motocal --version`), the GUI ("À propos" page), and this checklist
   all read from it).
2. Move the relevant `CHANGELOG.md` section from `## [Unreleased] — Sprint
   N — ...` to a dated, versioned heading (`## [0.2.0-beta.1] —
   2026-07-14`), following the file's existing Keep a Changelog format.
3. Run the full test suite, ruff, and mypy — a release is never built
   from a red or unverified tree (see §5, "Pre-release verification").
4. Generate the Linux build (§2).
5. Generate the Windows build on a Windows machine (§3) — cannot be
   cross-compiled from Linux/macOS (see `docs/PACKAGING.md` §3).
6. Assemble both builds, checksums, and the top-level project files into
   the local `Release/` folder (§4).
7. Tag the commit and publish a GitHub Release with the assembled
   archives attached (§6).

---

## 2. Generating the Linux build

```bash
# From the project root, with the project's own venv active
# (flet-cli is a `gui` extra dependency — pip install motorsport-calendar[gui])
flet build linux motorsport_calendar/gui --module-name app
```

Output: `motorsport_calendar/gui/build/linux/` — see
`docs/PACKAGING.md` §6.1 for exactly what this folder contains
(executable, `lib/`, `python3.12/`, `site-packages/`, `data/`) and §6.2
for what it does/doesn't require on the target machine.

Prerequisites (system toolchain, Flutter SDK) are documented in
`docs/PACKAGING.md` §2 — not repeated here.

**Before packaging any output for release**, always smoke-test the
compiled binary directly — never assume a successful `flet build` means
a working app (see `docs/PACKAGING.md` §6 for exactly this mistake, the
first time this project's own Linux build was actually launched):

```bash
cd motorsport_calendar/gui/build/linux
./motorsport-calendar
```

The window must actually open (not just "the command exits 0"). If it
doesn't, check `~/.cache/motorsport-calendar/console.log` for a Python
traceback — an empty file with the process still running past a few
seconds is the expected, healthy signal (confirmed against this exact
project — see `docs/PACKAGING.md` §7).

### Packaging the Linux build for distribution

```bash
cd motorsport_calendar/gui/build
VERSION="0.2.0-beta.1"   # match pyproject.toml
tar -czf "motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz" -C linux .
sha256sum "motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz" \
    > "motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256"
```

A `.tar.gz` (not a raw folder) is the distributable unit — see §4 for
where it lands in `Release/`.

---

## 3. Generating the Windows build

Must be run on an actual Windows machine — Flet does not support
cross-compiling a Windows build from Linux or macOS (see
`docs/PACKAGING.md` §3 for the prerequisites: Visual Studio 2022/2026
with the "Desktop development with C++" workload, Developer Mode
enabled).

```powershell
flet build windows motorsport_calendar/gui --module-name app
```

Output: `motorsport_calendar\gui\build\windows\` — a folder containing
the compiled `.exe` and its bundled dependencies, `icon_windows.ico`
used automatically for the executable/taskbar icon (see
`docs/PACKAGING.md` §3 for what's not yet verified about this build —
it has never been produced for real in this environment, no Windows
machine available).

### Packaging the Windows build for distribution

```powershell
$VERSION = "0.2.0-beta.1"   # match pyproject.toml
Compress-Archive -Path "motorsport_calendar\gui\build\windows\*" `
    -DestinationPath "motorsport-calendar-$VERSION-windows-x64.zip"
Get-FileHash "motorsport-calendar-$VERSION-windows-x64.zip" -Algorithm SHA256 |
    Select-Object Hash | Out-File "motorsport-calendar-$VERSION-windows-x64.zip.sha256"
```

## 4. Assembling the `Release/` folder

Proposed local staging layout — never committed (see §7, add `Release/`
to `.gitignore`), regenerated fresh for each release rather than
accumulated:

```
Release/
├── Linux/
│   ├── motorsport-calendar-0.2.0-beta.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
│   └── motorsport-calendar-0.2.0-beta.1-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256
├── Windows/
│   ├── motorsport-calendar-0.2.0-beta.1-windows-x64.zip
│   └── motorsport-calendar-0.2.0-beta.1-windows-x64.zip.sha256
├── Source/
│   └── motorsport-calendar-0.2.0-beta.1-source.tar.gz
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

Notes on each entry:

- **`Linux/`/`Windows/`** — one archive + one checksum file each, from
  §2/§3. Never the raw uncompressed build folders (148 MB of loose files
  is not something to hand a user or attach to a GitHub Release
  comfortably).
- **`Source/`** — a plain source archive (`git archive` output, or
  `python -m build --sdist`). Partially redundant with GitHub's own
  auto-generated "Source code (tar.gz/zip)" links on every Release page
  — kept here mainly for a user who wants a single download location
  covering every artifact without relying on GitHub's auto-generated
  links, not because GitHub requires it.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`/`LICENSE`/`README.md`** — plain copies of the
  project-root files at release time, so `Release/` is self-describing
  even if extracted and shared standalone, away from the repository.

```bash
# From the project root
VERSION="0.2.0-beta.1"
mkdir -p "Release/Linux" "Release/Windows" "Release/Source"

cp motorsport_calendar/gui/build/motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz* Release/Linux/
cp motorsport_calendar/gui/build/motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-windows-x64.zip* Release/Windows/   # copied from the Windows machine
git archive --format=tar.gz -o "Release/Source/motorsport-calendar-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz" HEAD
cp CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md Release/
```

---

## 5. Pre-release verification

Never build a release from an unverified tree:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/mypy motorsport_calendar
```

All three must be clean (or only carry the already-documented, accepted
mypy Flet-stub debt — see `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`'s debt table) before
tagging. This is a repeat of the same gate every sprint in this project
already runs before considering its own work done — a release is not
exempt.

---

## 6. Publishing a GitHub Release

```bash
# 1. Tag the commit the release is built from
git tag -a v0.2.0-beta.1 -m "Motorsport Calendar 0.2.0-beta.1"
git push origin v0.2.0-beta.1

# 2. Create the Release and attach every archive + checksum from Release/
gh release create v0.2.0-beta.1 \
    Release/Linux/*.tar.gz Release/Linux/*.sha256 \
    Release/Windows/*.zip Release/Windows/*.sha256 \
    Release/Source/*.tar.gz \
    --title "Motorsport Calendar 0.2.0-beta.1" \
    --notes-file <(sed -n '/## \[0.2.0-beta.1\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | sed '$d') \
    --prerelease
```

Notes:

- `--prerelease` marks it as a Beta on GitHub's own UI (grey "Pre-release"
  badge instead of the green "Latest") — remove once the project reaches
  a real `1.0.0`.
- `--notes-file` extracts the just-published `CHANGELOG.md` section for
  this version as the Release description, instead of writing release
  notes twice — the `sed` range prints from this version's heading up to
  (excluding) the next `## [` heading.
- `gh release create` also auto-generates GitHub's own "Source code
  (tar.gz)"/"(zip)" links regardless of whether `Release/Source/` is
  attached — this is expected, not a duplicate to remove (see §4's note
  on `Source/`).
- This entire step (tag + `gh release create`) is the only one in this
  procedure that publishes anything externally — confirm §5 passed and
  the Linux binary was smoke-tested (§2) before running it. Nothing
  before this point is visible outside the local machine.

---

## 7. Housekeeping

- `Release/` should be added to `.gitignore` (same reasoning as `build/`
  — a regenerated local staging area, never a tracked directory).
- Re-run this entire procedure for every release; there is no
  incremental/partial release flow documented here on purpose — each
  Release folder is produced fresh from a clean, verified tree (§5).

---

## 8. Known gaps (tracked, not blocking this document)

- ~~The Linux build's `ModuleNotFoundError` blocker~~ — **fixed**, see
  `docs/PACKAGING.md` §7.
- The embedded build version still reads `1.0.0` instead of the real
  `0.2.0` (cosmetic, `docs/PACKAGING.md` §7's own note) — not blocking
  a release, but worth a narrower follow-up fix.
- The Windows build fix is unverified — the same manifest/mechanism
  should apply identically (§3), but has never been run on a real
  Windows machine.
- No CI workflow runs any of this automatically yet — every step above
  is manual. A future GitHub Actions workflow triggered on tag push
  could run §2/§5/§6 (Linux only; §3 still needs a Windows runner) —
  tracked in `docs/TODO.md`, not attempted this sprint.
- No code signing (Windows Authenticode, Linux package signing) — a
  Beta distributed to a small/trusted audience can reasonably skip this;
  a wider public release should not.
